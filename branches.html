      <p>Botany is the scientific study of plants, or multicellular organisms, that carry on photosynthesis. As a branch of biology, botany sometimes is referred to as plant science or plant biology. Botany includes a wide range of scientific subdisciplines that study the structure, growth, reproduction, metabolism, development, diseases, ecology and evolution of plants. The study of plants is important because they are a fundamental part of life on Earth, generating food, oxygen, fuel, medicine and fibers that allow other life forms to exist. Through photosynthesis they absorb carbon dioxide, a waste product generated by most animals and a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.</p>
      <p>As with other forms of life, plants can be studied at many different levels. One is the molecular level, which is concerned with the biochemical, molecular and genetic functions of plants. Another is the cellular, tissue and organelle (a discrete structure of a cell that has a specialized function) level, which studies the anatomy and physiology of plants; and the community and population level, which involves interactions within a species, with other species and with the environment.

        Historically, botanists studied any living being that was not an animal. Although fungi, algae and bacteria now are members of other kingdoms, according to the currently accepted classification system, they usually still are studied in introductory botany classes.</p>
      <h5>SUBDISCIPLINES OF BOTANY</h5>
      <p>Agronomy and Crop Science - This is an agricultural science dealing with field crop production and soil management.</p>
      <p>Algology and Phycology - This is the study of algae.</p>
      <p>Bacteriology - This is the study of bacteria (also considered part of microbiology).</p>
      <p>Bryology - This is the study of mosses and liverworts.</p>
      <p>Mycology - This is the study of fungi.</p>
      <p>Paleobotany - This is the study of plant fossils</p>
      <p>Plant Anatomy and Physiology - This is the study of the structure and function of plants.</p>
      <p>Plant Cell Biology - This is the study of the structure and function of cells.</p>
      <p>Plant Genetics - This is the study of genetic inheritance in plants.</p>
      <p>Plant Pathology - This is the study of diseases in plants.</p>
      <p>Pteridology - This is the study of ferns and their relatives.</p>
      <p>Plants always have been convenient organisms to study scientifically because they did not pose the same ethical dilemmas as the study of animals or humans. The Austrian monk Gregor Mendel wrote the first laws of inheritance, a set of primary tenets relating to the transmission of hereditary characteristics from parent organisms to their children, in the 1850s after crossing pea plants in his garden. Nearly a century later, Barbara McClintock discovered “jumping genes” and other details about inheritance by studying maize plants.</p>

          <p>Zoology (also known as animal science) is the branch of biology devoted to the study of animal life. It covers areas ranging from the structure of organisms to the subcellular unit of life. Some zoologists are interested in the biology of particular groups of animals. Others are concerned with the structure and function of animal bodies. Still others study how new animals are formed and how their characteristics are passed on from one generation to another. Zoologists study the interactions of animals with one another and their environments, as well as the significance of the behavior of animals.</p>
          <P>Zoology is both descriptive and analytical. It can be approached either as a basic science or as an applied science. A worker in basic zoology is interested in knowledge of animals for its own sake without consideration of the direct application of the information gained. In contrast, workers in applied zoology are interested in information that will directly benefit humans and animals (medicine, for example).</P>
          <h5>SUBDISCIPLINES OF ZOOLOGY</h5>
          <P>Subdisciplines that concentrate on specific divisions of animal life:</P>
          <P>Entomology - Insects</P>
          <P>Herpetology - Amphibians and reptiles</P>
          <P>Ichthyology - Fish</P>
          <P>Invertebrate Zoology - Animals without backbones</P>
          <P>Malacology - Mollusks</P>
          <P>Mammalogy - Mammals</P>
          <P>Ornithology - Birds</P>
          <p>Primatology - Primates</p>
          <p>Sociobiology - Behavior, ecology and evolution of social animals such as bees, ants, schooling fish, flocking birds and humans</p>
          <p>The types of jobs zoologists perform also are quite diverse. The zoology undergraduate major is chosen by many students who seek a career in one of the several health care professions (veterinary medicine, medicine, dentistry) or careers in the environmental sciences. Jobs are available in the agricultural, biotechnological/pharmaceutical and environmental/ecological fields. There are jobs available working outdoors doing fieldwork as well as working in a lab. Career options include positions in government departments, environmental agencies, education (including universities and colleges) and industry (including consulting firms and biomedical companies). Depending on the way the biological sciences are organized at a particular college or university, the student interested in majoring in zoology actually could receive a degree in biology with a concentration in zoology.</p>

      <p>Micro-organisms and their activities are vitally important to virtually all processes on Earth. Micro-organisms matter because they affect every aspect of our lives – they are in us, on us and around us. Microbiology is the study of all living organisms that are too small to be visible with the naked eye. This includes bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, prions, protozoa and algae, collectively known as 'microbes'. </p>
        <p>These microbes play key roles in nutrient cycling, biodegradation/biodeterioration, climate change, food spoilage, the cause and control of disease, and biotechnology. Thanks to their versatility, microbes can be put to work in many ways: making life-saving drugs, the manufacture of biofuels, cleaning up pollution, and producing/processing food and drink.</p>
        <h5>SUBDISCIPLINES OF ZOOLOGY</h5>
        <p>Bacteria - More than just pathogens - can be friend or foe.</p>
        <p>Viruses - Smallest of all the microbes, but are they alive?</p>
        <p>Fungi - More than just mushrooms.</p>
        <p>Protozoa - Microbes with a taste for poo and so much more.</p>
        <p>Algae - Microbial powerhouses essential for life.</p>
        <p>Algae - Microbial powerhouses essential for life.</p>
        <p>Prions - Mysterious misfolding proteins.</p>
        <p>Microbiology research has been, and continues to be, central to meeting many of the current global aspirations and challenges, such as maintaining food, water and energy security for a healthy population on a habitable earth. Microbiology research will also help to answer big questions such as 'how diverse is life on Earth?', and 'does life exist elsewhere in the Universe'?</p>
